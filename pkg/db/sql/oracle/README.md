# DB Connection Oracle

according to [godror run time requirements](<[https://](https://github.com/godror/godror#run-time-requirements)>) for connection to Oracle DB need:

- Oracle Client libraries - see [ODPI-C Installation](https://oracle.github.io/odpi/doc/installation.html)

Although Oracle Client libraries are NOT required for compiling, they are needed at run time. Download the free Basic or Basic Light package from [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html).
